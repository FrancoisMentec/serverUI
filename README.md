# serverUI
It's a web UI built with nodejs to manage your computer from everywhere in a browser
It works with nodejs sever side, jQuery client side (no framework used) and socket.io to communicate with server

## Configure
Open config.json  
**password** is the password to connect (default 'pass')  
**port** is the port which the web server is started (default 8000)  
**musicDirectories** is an array with the path of every folder where you want to search for music (default [])  

## Install
Install node.js

On windows start Node.js command prompt
On linux just open a terminal

Go in your project and run `npm install`

Now you can start the server : `node index.js`

Open the app in any browser, the url is : http://*your_ip*:*port* (default port is 8000)
